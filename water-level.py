# waterFSM is really a display module
#  it has some functions like start, processEvent and buttons
#    it should do whatever is necessary for the keypress processing and get that out of the main loop
#  it has some portals for varibles to be displayed: temperature, pressure, water level, etc.
#    these are defined in the display module and need to be referred to from here
#  it has some portals for configurable constants: TIME_TIME, etc.

# need to work in actual measurements
#  add smoothing function(s)
#  add a wave detector
#    measure peak-to-peak, period and duration (maybe a series: +3,-3,+2.5,-2.5... with times
#    period is done with a zero crossing detection. peak is max between zeros.
#    we'll have to see what is important

# should turn off LED on exit... maybe after a few second delay...
# historically this program had a dump of raw values. should it retain that capability and send such a string to the RESTful process? Let's say no for now

want to implement a zero crossing detector and peak detector

for a simple report, say every 10 seconds or so
  report the peak wave seen in that period
  report the average wave seen in that period
  recording bit:
    append peak to list
  reporting bit


want to distinguish between waves and wakes
a wake has a short total duration, period is fairly constant and peaks decrease exponentially
  can get confused if ther are multiple wakes
    it should be expressed something like: time, max p-p, period, duration

The power energy of a wave (kW/m) = (ro * g * g / 64 / Math.pi) * H * H * Te
where
 ro is the density of water (999.97 kg/m/m/m) (999.0 might be more reasonable 15c)
 g is the gravitational constant (6.67385 * 10**-11 m m m/kg/s/s)
 H is the wave height in meters
 Te is the wave period in seconds

The first part is constant, so only have to compute the second half
  this is approximately .5 kW/m/m/m/s
waves are more continuous
  periods are fairly random
  p-p are fairly random
    expressed as a range of p-p and periods


joules = 1000 kilowatt/s

# can use pipes or other interprocess communication to decouple the processes
# one for the main loop for doing the basic measurements
# one to do the display thing
