Notes

had:
BUFFER_SIZE =  2**10 # or about 30 seconds at 30 samples/second
MINIMUM_NUMBER_OF_CYCLES = 3

seemed a bit insensitive, so trying:
BUFFER_SIZE =  2**8 # or about 8.5 seconds at 30 samples/second
MINIMUM_NUMBER_OF_CYCLES = 1

this was very slow, changing back for now

this may even speed it up a tad, even though also trying to do these at
0.2 seconds instead of 1.0 seconds.
