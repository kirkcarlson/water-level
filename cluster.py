  """The consolidated conditions a cluster of power spikes

  A cluster is a series of related waves. Sea waves are near the same period.
  A cluster begins with the detection of coherent waves.
  A cluster ends with the lack of coherent waves for more than one wave period,
  an abrupt change in period, or decrease of power to triggering threshold.
  ... it could be a change in slope of energy to separate "hay stacks" or
  "lumps."

  A cluster is initialized with current values and watch criteria.

  Periodically a value is evaluated by the watch to set the maximum, minimum,
  etc.

  Attributes:
    name: a name representing the consolidated conditions
    level: the current value
    trend: the current value trend (rising, falling, neutral)
    min: the minimum value during the period
    max: the maximum value during the period
    maxRiseRate: the maximum positive change during the period
    maxFallRate: the maximum negative change during the period
    reversals: the number of trend reversals in the period
    startTick: epoch of consolidation (s)
